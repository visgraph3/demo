Welcome to RDF API for PHP

This directory contains some demo scripts that show you how to use RAP.

Many scripts require a working config.php file, so make a copy of
 "config.php.dist", save it as "config.php" and adjust it.

Execute "setup.php" on the command line to create all the necessary tables
 in the database.

"unit/" directory contains the unit tests for RAP. They ensure that nothing
 breaks during development. See the Readme in there for more information.

Also remember there is documentation for RAP available at
 http://rdfapi-php.sf.net/
